# NYC Housing Project

This project explores the issue of affordable housing in New York City through data analysis and visualization, using a dataset from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD). As Columbia graduate students, we have personally experienced the difficulties in finding affordable housing which inspired us to delve into this topic of the city’s housing initiatives. We aim to have a deeper understanding of the city’s housing landscape.

    "text": "1 Introduction\nFinding affordable housing is a crucial factor when it comes to living in New York City, where the population density is high, real estate prices continue to rise, and income inequality persists. As graduate students living in NYC, we have firsthand experience of the challenges posed by the city’s housing market. We have faced difficulties in finding suitable housing and settling down in this vibrant but expensive city. These experiences have allowed us to appreciate the importance of understanding how affordable housing initiatives shaped the lives of residents and contribute to the city’s socioeconomic dynamic. Access to affordable housing is not only a matter of financial stability but also an important aspect of urban equity as well as a key factor to fostering a community’s well-being. This project allows us to explore this issue through data analysis, leveraging a dataset from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD). We aim to find trends, disparities, and provide insights in affordable housing development across NYC and hope to contribute to a broader understanding of NYC’s housing landscape and its implications.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe project aims to analyze affordable housing units in NYC. The dataset originates from The Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), a department of the government of NYC dedicated to ensuring quality and affordable housing while sustaining neighborhood strength and diversity.\nThe dataset can be easily accessed by downloading the CSV file from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Affordable-Housing-Production-by-Building/hg8x-zxpr/about_data, which can be directed via the NYC Housing Preservation & Development government website (https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/about/open-data.page).\nThe dataset was compiled by HPD using various methods, including wage information for housing development projects as mandated by Local Law 44, registration details from owners of residential rental properties, and survey data from housing units across the city. It consists of 41 columns and 7,637 rows, with each row representing details of a housing development or preservation project. According to the HPD, the dataset was first published to the public on December 20, 2016. It undergoes quarterly updates and the most recent update occurred on September 23, 2024.\nOne notable issue with the dataset is that some entries in the Project Completion Date column remain empty, indicating that the project is still ongoing. Therefore, it is necessary to manually input NA values to these empty entries.\nCode\ncolnames(data)\n\n\n [1] \"Project.ID\"                         \"Project.Name\"                      \n [3] \"Project.Start.Date\"                 \"Project.Completion.Date\"           \n [5] \"Building.ID\"                        \"Number\"                            \n [7] \"Street\"                             \"Borough\"                           \n [9] \"Postcode\"                           \"BBL\"                               \n[11] \"BIN\"                                \"Community.Board\"                   \n[13] \"Council.District\"                   \"Census.Tract\"                      \n[15] \"NTA...Neighborhood.Tabulation.Area\" \"Latitude\"                          \n[17] \"Longitude\"                          \"Latitude..Internal.\"               \n[19] \"Longitude..Internal.\"               \"Building.Completion.Date\"          \n[21] \"Reporting.Construction.Type\"        \"Extended.Affordability.Only\"       \n[23] \"Prevailing.Wage.Status\"             \"Extremely.Low.Income.Units\"        \n[25] \"Very.Low.Income.Units\"              \"Low.Income.Units\"                  \n[27] \"Moderate.Income.Units\"              \"Middle.Income.Units\"               \n[29] \"Other.Income.Units\"                 \"Studio.Units\"                      \n[31] \"X1.BR.Units\"                        \"X2.BR.Units\"                       \n[33] \"X3.BR.Units\"                        \"X4.BR.Units\"                       \n[35] \"X5.BR.Units\"                        \"X6.BR..Units\"                      \n[37] \"Unknown.BR.Units\"                   \"Counted.Rental.Units\"              \n[39] \"Counted.Homeownership.Units\"        \"All.Counted.Units\"                 \n[41] \"Total.Units\"\nData Explanation\nThis project does not require every column from the dataset, as its focus is on analyzing affordable housing units in NYC.

The rest of the boroughs marked approximately equal rate of NA values at around 20%. This analysis may highlight a clear geographic trend in the missing data, with Queens emerging as the most problematic borough with ongoing projects and Staten Island being the least affected with most of projects completed.

Consistent with the first figure, it shows that the rental units outnumber homeownership units.\nOver these five years, both homeownership and rental units usually experienced a rapid increase in cumulative units in June, except for 2020, which saw the highest increase in March. After the steep slope, the growth of homeownership units flattens for majority of the months while the rental units exhibits smaller monthly increments later in the year. The quarterly data update explains the significant increases in March, June, September, and December.\nThis figure presents the annual number of newly constructed housing units across the five boroughs of New York, providing insights into the temporal and spatial distribution of housing development. It highlights boroughs with the highest number of new units and the decline in construction activity in the most recent years (post 2020). Overall, Brooklyn and Bronx consistently mark the highest levels of construction activity annually while Staten Island records the lowest.\nFocusing on the number of newly constructed units per unit type (studio, one bedroom, …, six or more bedrooms), the figure above breaks the previous graph into facets. The trend of Bronx and Brooklyn marking the highest construction activity and Staten Island having the lowest persist across all the unit types, implying that the proportion of newly constructed units are same across the five boroughs. Notably, no units with five or more bedrooms were newly constructed within the time period covered by the data.\n\n\nCode\nconstructionData &lt;- constructionData |&gt;\n  filter(ProjectDuration != 0)\n\nggplot(constructionData, aes(x = ProjectDuration, y = Total.Units)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.2) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Borough) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Scatterplot of Project Duration vs Total Housing Units by Borough\",\n    x = \"Project Duration (Days)\",\n    y = \"Total Units\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scatterplot examines the relationship between project duration (in days) and the total number of housing units for each construction project across the five boroughs. By visualizing these patterns, we aim to compare housing construction patterns and identify borough specific trends. As concluded from the previous figure, Staten Island recorded the fewest number of newly constructed units, preventing us from drawing meaningful conclusions for that borough. Across all boroughs, most construction projects ended within 1,000 days while a few extending between 1,000 days to 2,000 days.",

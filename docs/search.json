Our analysis revealed that these NA values originated from the same rows. Specifically, all 1,531 missing values in the Latitude column also corresponded to missing values in the Longitude columns. The cluster within specific observations suggests a possible pattern related to data collection issues or specific subsets in the dataset.\n\n\nCode\nplot_missing(data, max_cols = 5, percent = FALSE) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother visualization reveals the same pattern of the NA values. Approximately 6,000 rows have complete data across the columns, while around 1,500 rows have missing values in the Longitude and Latitude columns. The visualization highlights that the NA values in these two columns consistently originate from the same rows.\n\n\nCode\nall_boroughs &lt;- unique(data$Borough)\n\nNA_grouping &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(Borough) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    num_rows = n(),\n    NA_num = sum(is.na(Latitude)),\n    NA_percent = (NA_num / num_rows) * 100\n  )\n\nggplot(NA_grouping, aes(x = Borough, y = NA_percent, fill = Borough)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Percentage of NA Values in Latitude & Longitude Column by Borough\",\n    x = \"Borough\",\n    y = \"Percentage of NA Values\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine whether missing values in the Latitude and Longitude columns are correlated with values of another variable, we analyzed the percentage of NA values by borough (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island). The results reveal that Staten Island marked the highest rate of NA values for both columns (approximately 87%) while Manhattan had the lowest proportion (approximately 4%). This analysis highlights a clear geographic trend in the missing data, with Staten Island and Queens emerging as the most problematic boroughs and Manhattan being the least affected.",
